    <p >
      Machine learning, simply put, is a type of artificial intelligence when
      computers are programmed to learn information without human intervention.
      In machine learning, the development of the underlying algorithms rely on
      computational statistics. Computers are provided data and then the
      computers “learn” from that data. The data actually “teaches" the computer
      by revealing its complex patterns and underlying algorithms leading to
      knowledge about the data, new insights, and potential for new discovery.
      The larger the sample of data the “machine" is provided, the more precise
      the machine's output becomes. But what is machine learning in healthcare?
      And why is there such an emphasis on the importance of machine learning in
      healthcare?

      Machine learning in healthcare is becoming more widely used and is helping
      patients and clinicians by overcoming industry challenges and creating a
      more unified system to improve work processes. The most common healthcare
      use cases for machine learning are automating medical billing, clinical
      decision support and the development of clinical care guidelines. There
      are many notable high-level examples of machine learning and healthcare
      concepts being applied in science and medicine. At MD Anderson,
      researchers have developed the first medical machine learning algorithm to
      predict acute toxicities in patients receiving radiation therapy for head
      and neck cancers. In radiology, deep learning in healthcare identifies
      complex patterns automatically, and helps radiologists make intelligent
      decisions reviewing images such as conventional radiographs, CT, MRI, PET
      images and radiology reports based on the insights that are generated. The
      performance of machine learning-based automatic detection and diagnosis
      systems has shown to be equivalent to that of an experienced radiologist.
      Google’s machine learning applications in healthcare were trained to
      detect breast cancer and achieved 89 percent accuracy, on par or better
      than radiologists. These are just a few of examples of the many uses of
      machine learning in healthcare.

      Unstructured healthcare data for machine learning represents almost 80% of
      the information held or “locked” in electronic health record systems.
      These are not data elements but documents or text files which in the past
      could not be analyzed without a human reading through the material. Human
      language, or “natural language,” is very complex, lacking uniformity and
      incorporates an enormous amount of ambiguity, jargon, and vagueness. In
      order to convert these documents into more useful and analyzable data,
      machine learning in healthcare often relies on natural language processing
      (NLP) programs. Most deep learning in healthcare applications that use NLP
      require some form of medical machine learning. Healthcare use cases for
      machine learning are many. For example, the same NLP technology that is
      used to determine creditworthiness for a consumer or sentiment analysis of
      someone’s social media post can now be used to read a patient’s chart to
      extract important data elements like the patient’s medications, treatment
      plans and medical conditions.
