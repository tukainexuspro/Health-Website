          Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic
          disorders characterized by a high blood sugar level (hyperglycemia)
          over a prolonged period of time. Symptoms often include frequent
          urination, increased thirst and increased appetite. If left untreated,
          diabetes can cause many health complications.Acute complications can
          include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or
          death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease,
          stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, damage to the nerves,
          damage to the eyes and cognitive impairment.
