            There is a demand to make such a system that will help end users to
            predict diseases on the basis of symptoms given in it without
            visiting hospitals. By doing so, it will decrease the rush at OPDâ€Ÿs
            of hospitals and bring down the workload on medical staff.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Not only this, this system will reduce the costly treatment and
            panic moment at the end stages so that proper medication can be
            provided at the right time and we can lower down the death rate as
            well.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            This system also consists of a feature of Database which stores the
            data entered by the end users and the name of the disease the
            patient is suffering from that can be used as a past record and will
            help in further treatment in future.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The analysis accuracy is increased by using Machine Learning
            algorithms. Altogether this system will help in easier health
            management
